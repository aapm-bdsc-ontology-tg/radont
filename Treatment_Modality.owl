        <rdfs:comment>&apos;Plan&apos; includes a future direction sense. That can be problematic if plans are changed during their execution. There are however implicit contingencies for protocols that an agent has in his mind that can be considered part of the plan, even if the agent didn&apos;t have them in mind before. Therefore, a planned process can diverge from what the agent would have said the plan was before executing it, by adjusting to problems encountered during execution (e.g. choosing another reagent with equivalent properties, if the originally planned one has run out.)

We are only considering successfully completed planned processes. A plan may be modified, and details added during execution. For a given planned process, the associated realized plan specification is the one encompassing all changes made during execution. This means that all processes in which an agent acts towards achieving some objectives is a planned process.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This type of radiation is a photon that is emitted from the nucleus of an atom that undergoes some sort of decay.  Gamma rays are monoenergetic, although it is typical for a given type of nucleus to undergo different types of decay and/or transitions to a range of energy levels; this results in a set of energies that are characteristic of a given isotopic source.  The energies range from the keV region to MeV region.  Their interactions with tissue are identical to x-rays of the same energy since both types of radiation are photons.

This type of radiation can be used for external beam radiation therapy (where the source of radiation is outside the body) or brachytherapy (where the source is placed within the body).

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Radiation emitted from a radiation therapy source can be of several different types.  Each type has a unique set of physical characteristics, such as charge and mass.  In addition, they fall into different classes of particles, such as boson and lepton, in addition to other classifications.

In this ontology, the focus is on those characteristics that affect how the radiation is produced, how it interacts with matter, and the radiobiological effects.

SNOMED does have classes but they are somewhat confused.  &quot;Ionizing radiation&quot; is a child of radiation, but so is &quot;electromagnetic radiation&quot; which has as a child &quot;ionizing electromagnetic radiation&quot;.  Both have same URI http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/SNOMEDCT/312255008
Under each of these classes, there is the same child &quot;gamma radiation&quot;</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This type of radiation is produced by means of bremmstrahlung where the electrons have an energy less than approximately 500 keV.  Additionally, there are often x-rays produced by atomic transitions, such as K-edge x-rays.  This type of radiation is most often used for imaging due to the differential absorption of the x-rays by different parts of the body.  In radiation therapy, these images are used to devise a treatment plan and also to localize the target region when setting up for therapy.  

This type is sometimes used for cancers located in the skin or close to the surface since it is rapidly attenuated in the body.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This type of radiation is a particle with charge of +1 and a mass of 938 MeV.  (This is much greater than the mass of an electron).  They are produced in large accelerators, e.g. cyclotrons.  The radiation beams are monoenergetic and, for therapeutic purposes, the range is approximately 100 to 250 MeV.  The large mass of this type of radiation makes it more difficult to accelerate them to the desired energy and to steer them to the patient; this results in some practical difficulties when using them in a medical environment.  

Protons undergo many collisions in which they lose energy but, unlike electrons, their trajectories are little affected.  The absorption of energy from a beam of protons exhibits a &quot;Bragg peak&quot;, which means that as they penetrate the body, the energy absorbed per distance is relatively constant (&quot;plateau&quot;) until they have lost nearly all of there energy, at which point the absorbed energy per distance rises sharply until all the energy is absorbed, the proton stops and no energy is absorbed at greater depths (&quot;Bragg peak&quot;).

It contains the &apos;gross tumor volume&apos; and the &apos;clinical target volume&apos;. This uncertainty is due to movement of the target volume relative to the anatomy of the patient (for example, the prostate position is influenced by bowel and rectal filling) and uncertainty in setting up the external anatomy of the patient.  It is expected that the dimensions are such that for every radiation treatment session, the gross tumor volume and the clinical target volume will lie within the radiation field.
